# Swarmatron CPP

This is a pure c++ implementation of the Dewanatron Swarmatron for the Bela system.

My interpreation of it anyway.

It utilises two Trill Bars and a Bela Mini so it can be housed in a small box for ease of portability. Because of this size limitation it does not have fundamental note tuning or individual voice detuning.

## Funtionality

Bar 1: Left to right horizontal motion controls tone. Size of touch controls amplitude for expressiveness.

Bar 2: Left to right horizontal motion controls spread of voices. Size of touch controls number of audible voices. (WIP)
